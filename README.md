### Lack of security and inefficient management of records leads to enfeeble law and order in the city. Also, there are so many facilities the Police can provide to its people, but often the problem is the medium of offering these services. Hence the Mumbai Police Web Application provides a platform which unifies the people and the police thereby strengthening the legal system of the country.
